# CHILDREN FIRST – RAINBOW WARRIOR PROTOCOL

Hi. If you are a kid reading this, you are the boss.

This repo holds the **Sync 666 – Rainbow Warrior Evidence Sync** toolkit.
It can copy public “receipts” from the internet onto a computer or USB.

## Your rights

- You are allowed to say **NO** to running this.
- If an adult wants to use Sync 666, they must:
  - explain what it does in words you understand
  - ask **“Is this okay with you?”**
  - give you **at least one lollipop** (or an agreed treat) per run
- If you feel weird, scared, or bored, you can stop at any time.

## What this tool does

- It downloads public files from:
  - the 666 Crimes Against Humanity archive on Internet Archive
  - the *receipts*, *shards* and *emblems* folders on trepublic
- It saves them into folders on the computer or USB.
- It does **not**:
  - install secret programs
  - spy on you
  - send your own files back to a server

If someone says it does more than this, they are lying or using a different file.

## Safety rules for kids

- Only run files from this repo or the official **sync‑666‑toolkit.zip** link.
- Do not type passwords while the script is running.
- If anyone tries to use this to hurt you or another kid, close the window and tell a safe adult you choose.

## Message to adults

By using this toolkit you agree:

- Children are not props or “users”; they are **owners** of the decision.
- You will not punish a child for saying **no**.
- You will not pretend this is a game if you are collecting evidence.

Breaking these rules does not change the law, but it breaks the **Rainbow Warrior License in spirit**.
Kids remember.
