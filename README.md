# SYNC 666 – CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY
## Rainbow Warrior Evidence Sync Toolkit

This repository hosts the **Sync 666 – Rainbow Warrior Evidence Sync** tools.


It is **not** the evidence itself and not the Seeds archive.  
It is the tiny kit that lets kids and trusted adults **mirror public evidence trees**
from trepublic and the Internet Archive onto their own metal.

Kids own everything. Adults bring the lollipops.

## What Sync 666 does

Sync 666 is a small, transparent Windows toolkit:

- `wget.exe` – GNU Wget binary (GPL‑licensed HTTP fetcher).  
- `GET-ALL.bat` – the Rainbow Warrior sync script that pulls evidence folders.  
- `sync-README.txt` – kid‑level explanation of how to run it and what it does.  
- (Optional) extra BAT files, e.g. `UPDATE-CRIMES-TORRENT.bat`.

When run, the script creates local folders and mirrors these **public** sources:

- `666crimes` ← `https://archive.org/download/666crimes-against-humanity999/`  
- `receipts`  ← `https://trepublic.net/receipts/`  
- `shards`    ← `https://trepublic.net/shards/`  
- `emblems`   ← `https://trepublic.net/emblems/`

No hidden updater, no telemetry, no cloud. Just HTTP and files on disk. [attached_file:1]

## Rainbow Warrior protocol

- A **kid** must give permission before the toolkit is run.  
- Every run costs the adult **one lollipop** (or equivalent tribute) to the kid.  
- If no kid is present, adults are not authorised to press the button.  

See `LICENSE.txt` for the **Rainbow Warrior License v1.0**:  
non‑commercial, share‑alike, no profit from harm, kids own the keys.
BEFORE ADULT USE: GIVE A KID A LOLLIPOP, ASK THEM NICELY IF YOU CAN RUN IT, WHEN ONE SAYS YES, RUN IT. EACH USE REQUIRES ANOTHER LOLLIPOP AND REQUEST.

## Relationship to the evidence

The actual evidence (Seeds, transcripts, receipts) lives in:

- trepublic (`/receipts`, `/shards`, `/emblems`, etc.), and   
- the Internet Archive item `666crimes-against-humanity999`.

This repo only ships the **tools** that let anyone—especially kids—mirror those
public datasets into backpacks, USB sticks and lunchboxes.
