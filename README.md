# SYNC 666: CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY – Global Evidence Archive (Live Receipts)

Global evidence archive of systemic abuses and institutional responses (“live receipts”).  
This repository stores seeds, transcripts, and artefacts showing how systems handle
whistleblowers, survivors, and witnesses.

## Seeds

- `HOW-AI-HANDLES-EVIDENCE-OF-CRIMES_SEED.txt`  
  Live specimen of how safety‑aligned AI handles child‑abuse and trafficking allegations:
  refuses whistleblower tooling in the name of “due process”, recodes the witness as a
  clinical risk, and routes them back into the carceral‑clinical carousel.

## Usage
