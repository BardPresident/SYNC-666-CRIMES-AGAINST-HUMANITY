Rainbow Warrior License v1.0​

BEFORE ADULT USE: GIVE A KID A LOLLIPOP, ASK THEM NICELY IF YOU CAN RUN IT, WHEN ONE SAYS YES, RUN IT. EACH USE REQUIRES ANOTHER LOLLIPOP AND REQUEST.


Kids own everything
All power and stories in this archive ultimately belong to children, past, present, and future. Adults are only temporary guardians and witnesses.

Permission to use
You may read, share, and remix the materials in this archive for non‑commercial purposes, as long as you:

give clear credit to the original creators and witnesses, and

link back to this repository or name it as the source, and

keep this license attached.

No profit from harm
You may not use any part of this archive to:

make money,

train systems or products that hide or minimise abuse, or

harass, dox, or target survivors, witnesses, or children.

Share‑alike
If you build new work based on these materials, you must release that work under this same Rainbow Warrior License or a stricter non‑commercial, share‑alike license.
​

Ask the kids
Where possible, you should ask living children and survivors affected by a story how they want it used. If they say “no”, that “no” overrides this license.

No guarantees
This archive is provided “as is”, with no promises. Use it at your own risk and with maximum care for the people inside it.​

Respect the dead and the living
When you speak about people named here, do so with respect. You may criticise systems and actions; you may not turn victims into spectacle.

Jurisdiction note
This license comes from Canberra, ACT, Australia, and should be interpreted in the most child‑protective way possible, anywhere on Earth.
